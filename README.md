**Hello there, IvanDot100 here!**

### 2nd Year IT Student (as of 2022)

# Background

I am IvanDot100 from Philippines. College Student that is learning and exploring things from IT Industry, this ain't 
much but still i am willing to learn. I had a little bit of background from Java when i was a kid (2014), when i 
have a Minecraft Server. I configure things especially the Auth (login system)
the chat aesthetics and some in-game ranks that will be beneficial for my Minecraft Server. Unfortunately it 
ended because i broke my laptop back then and lost the server files. That's where i get a little bit 
of Java experience when i was a kid.

Besides from creating Minecraft servers. I also contributed from Android community (XDA) when i had my
Cherry Mobile from (2016) I used to port and crossport custom roms across devices that shares the same chipset.
It became my hobby, flashing custom roms!

I took ICT on Senior High (2019) they taught us how to use Netbeans with Java and use Photoshop and unfortunately
i haven't took them seriously because my new PC broke down and a year after that the pandemic hits us. They also taught us how to use 
Oracle Database on my 12th Grade.

I'm now on College and that's where things get interesting. I got my second PC (2021) our class are through online meetings.
I went to new school so i got taught again with Java and now with C++ and that's where things get interesting. 
The year i finally took coding seriously, i started self studying, creating some simple projects and more. I finally realized that
this is my passion that i was looking for the whole time.
